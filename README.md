# customer-churn-prediction-2

 Project:
Data Set Details: Each row corresponds to a client of a company for whom it has collected information about the type of plan they have contracted, the minutes they have talked, or the charge they pay every month.
The data set includes the following variables:
state: Categorical, for the 51 states and the District of Columbia.
Area.code
account.length: how long the account has Business Objective: Customer churn is a big problem for telecommunications companies. Indeed, their annual churn rates are usually higher than 10%. For that reason, they develop strategies to keep as many clients as possible. This is a classification project since the variable to be predicted is binary (churn or loyal customer). The goal here is to model churn probability, conditioned on the customer features. telecommunications
